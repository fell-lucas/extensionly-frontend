# Extensionly React Front-end

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). The tecnologies used will be React, TypeScript, Nextjs for the Server Side Rendering and [Jotai](https://github.com/pmndrs/jotai) as a state management solution.

## Getting Started

This project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as a package manager. Install the packages using

`pnpm i`

then, run the development server:

`pnpm dev`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
